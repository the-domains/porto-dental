![It is no secret that medical tourism has been on the rise over the last few decades. Prices in some countries are so high that they have forced patients to look for better options abroad. Even if it sounds a bit risky in the beginning, once they complete their treatments, and see the results of a truly professional dental work in their own mouths, most end up wondering why they hadn't done it before. Portugal is a great destination for dental tourism, chosen by a number of patients every year.
